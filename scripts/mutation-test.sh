# Mutation testing for dacli — the only honest audit of a test suite.
#
# Coverage says a line RAN. It does not say anything asserted its behavior.
# This flips one operator at a time in real source, re-runs the package's tests,
# and asks the only question that matters: did the suite NOTICE? A mutant that
# survives is a line your tests execute but do not actually check.
#
# Dependency-free by design: dacli's go.mod has zero requires and this must not
# change that, so there is no mutation framework here — just sed-style operator
# flips over a scratch copy, plus the repo's own `go test`. It is viable because
# the whole suite runs in well under a second.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/mutation-test.sh                       # audit the default package set
#   scripts/mutation-test.sh ./internal/gates      # audit one package
#   MUTANTS=40 scripts/mutation-test.sh            # cap the sample per package
#
# Exit status is 0 unless a package's kill rate falls below THRESHOLD, so this
# can gate CI once the suite is strong enough to hold a floor.
