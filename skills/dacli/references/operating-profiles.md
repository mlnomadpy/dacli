# Operating profiles

Resolve the mode through `dacli start` so selection, routing, budgets,
verification, landing, and recovery are visible as one policy:

The orchestrator agent selects the smallest profile that can deliver the
product outcome and judges its results. dacli resolves and enforces the profile;
worker coding CLIs execute its bounded tasks. Human intervention is reserved
for authority, exceptions, emergency stop, and release policy.

```bash
dacli start --project <project> --profile inspect --dry-run
dacli start --project <project> --profile task --dry-run
dacli start --project <project> --profile wave --width 3 --dry-run
dacli start --project <project> --profile loop --dry-run
dacli start --project <project> --profile service --dry-run
```

Use inspect for a read-only diagnosis; task for one bounded edit; wave for
independent ready tasks; loop for repeatable backlog work; and service only for
a resident single-project runner. `--configure` persists the resolution without
execution, while `--show --json` reads the persisted policy. Service supervises
repeated finite loops with a lease, STOP file, rolling budget, unknown-landing
halt, and infrastructure breaker. It is not a multi-repo control plane and it
does not enable releases.

For a manual wave, use `next --project <project> --parallel <width>`, worktrees
with disjoint claims, `wait`, `sync`, verification, and the project's landing
policy. Set WIP no higher than the number of safe claims, reviewers, and landing
capacity.

Launch each ready writer detached so the wave can overlap, then follow its returned run ID rather than an unqualified log stream:

```bash
dacli spawn --task <ref> --role <role> --worktree --claim <path> --max-tokens <n> --detach
dacli agents --tail
dacli logs <run-id> -f
dacli wait
dacli sync
```

For a loop, always preview first: `dacli loop --project <project> --width N --max-cycles N --dry-run`. The real run keeps a finite cycle count, per-cycle `--max-tokens`, rolling `--window-tokens`/`--token-window`, `--halt-after-idle`, and an explicit `--idle` backoff. `--yolo` is a deliberate override, never a synonym for unlimited spend or release publication.
