// The self-hosting fixture: dacli takes a repo from EMPTY to SHIPPED with no
// human in the loop, and the test asserts the outcome rather than the calls
// (issue #437 item 5).
//
// Why this could not be a unit test. Every guard along this arc was already
// unit-correct and green while the arc itself was broken — that is how task
// 312's three-way deadlock survived, and how issue #382 reported done:15/21
// with the commands absent. The only thing that catches a composition is
// running the composition.
//
// It drives the REAL binary as a subprocess, not the in-process dispatcher,
// because `ship` re-invokes dacli through os.Executable() — which under
// `go test` is the test binary, so an in-process ship re-enters the suite
// instead of running its accept step.
//
// Offline and deterministic: the "agent" is a shell script, so there is no
// model, no network, and no clock dependence. What is being proven is dacli's
// coordination, and a real agent would only add variance to a question that is
// not about the agent.
