// TestShipDoesNotStampAFalseUnlandedRecord is the dacli 329 regression.
//
// `dacli ship` runs `accept --all --force` BEFORE `integrate` — forced,
// because `integrate` refuses a task that is not yet done. That ordering
// means a landing check made DURING accept can only ever see "the branch is
// not yet in trunk", even for a task ship's own next step is seconds away
// from merging. Before the fix, every successful ship durably recorded
// "... exists but is NOT in trunk — closed anyway" on every task it closed
// and then landed, permanently misstating where the work ended up.
//
// This drives the real accept-then-integrate order through the actual
// binary (not a stub, unlike ship's own unit tests, which mock the shelled
// subcommands and so never exercise the landing check at all) and asserts
// the FINAL task record — after the whole ship pipeline has run — states the
// truth: merged, never "closed anyway".
