// TestWorkerProposedDoneIsLandedByTheToolNotByTheTest is the integration
// regression the 2026-08-10 suite audit asked for, and the arc that had ZERO
// coverage while every guard along it was unit-correct and green.
//
// The deadlock it guards (task 312): a spawned worker CLAIMS (an event the
// owner applies on sync, so the worker is still not the owner), therefore
// cannot check its own acceptance boxes (owner-gated by design), therefore
// files `task done` as a propose-status event that sync correctly refuses for
// unmet acceptance. `accept --all` could not see that channel at all, so the
// work sat open: agents committed real code and the loop halted on "no net
// progress" with the work finished and unlandable.
//
// The load-bearing detail is what this test REFUSES to do: it never calls
// `accept --force` itself. The existing end-to-end arc (TestE2EOwnershipGrantArc)
// routes around the defect precisely there — its child uses `accept` rather
// than `task done`, and the test itself performs the reconciliation. A test
// that reconciles by hand proves the command works when a human runs it, which
// was never in doubt; it cannot prove the TOOL closes the loop.
