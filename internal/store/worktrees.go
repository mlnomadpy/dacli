// accumulates one live checkout per task ever spawned with --worktree — a real
// run reached 86 worktrees / 2.2 GB (dacli 252). A worktree is returned only
// when we can PROVE it is dead, never on a failed probe:
//
//   - "branch gone" — the branch was already deleted (e.g. gcBranch removed it
//     but the worktree teardown failed): a dangling admin entry, always safe.
//   - "merged into <trunk>" — the branch is an ancestor of trunk AND entered
//     via a merge (its tip is NOT on trunk's first-parent mainline). The
//     bare-tip guard is essential: a just-spawned agent's branch carries zero
//     commits of its own and is trivially an ancestor of trunk, so ancestry
//     alone would delete a LIVE worktree mid-work (dacli 168, 241). A merged
//     worktree is reclaimed only when its tree is clean — uncommitted scratch
//     in it is unmerged work we must not force-remove.
//   - "run finished" — the task file for the branch sits in done/. The run is
//     over, so its scratch checkout is dead weight; the branch is kept.
//
// trunk is the local trunk branch (e.g. "main"); pass "" to skip the merged
// check. The workspace's own main worktree and every path in protect (e.g. the
// caller's cwd) are never returned.
