// different from "landed", and neither should be reported as success.
//
// This lives in the entity layer (not a feature slice) because both
// `accept` (features/acceptance) and `ship` (features/ship) need the exact
// same truthful check — accept to certify a close, ship to CORRECT that
// certification once its own later integrate step actually lands the
// branch accept could not yet see (dacli 329).
