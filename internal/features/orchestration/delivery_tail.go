// shallow clones) it fell straight through to a local `main`, which on a repo
// whose work lands on origin/master is a branch nothing ever reaches, making
// every progress measurement a measurement of the wrong thing.
//
// Order of preference, most authoritative first: what origin says its default
// is; then a remote-tracking branch, because trunk is where work LANDS and
// that is a property of the remote, not of this checkout; then a local branch,
// which is all an ordinary offline repo has; then the checked-out branch via
// symbolic-ref, which — unlike rev-parse --abbrev-ref — fails on a detached
