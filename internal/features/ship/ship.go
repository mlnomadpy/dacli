// Package ship is the one-command wave tail: `dacli ship` closes the loop the
// operator still runs by hand after a wave of agents finish — accept the done
// tasks, integrate their branches, commit the workspace record SAFELY, and
// (optionally) push. Every step the operator used to type is now one command
// that stops honestly at the first failure and never half-ships.
//
// It is a feature slice (ARCHITECTURE § 2b) and imports NO other slice. Because
// slices cannot call each other, ship ORCHESTRATES by shelling out to its own
// binary (os.Executable) — `dacli accept`, `dacli integrate` — exactly as the
// prompt templates tell agents to invoke dacli. The record commit and push are
// git operations done directly through the shared gitx layer (an entity
// package, so importing it is allowed): the record commit lands on the
// integration branch, where `dacli commit` refuses to run.
//
// The pipeline, stopping at the first non-zero step so nothing is left
// half-shipped:
//
//  1. accept   — shell `dacli accept --all --force --defer-landing [--verify
//     "cmd"]`: verify-then-close every task an agent proposed for acceptance.
//     --force is always passed — `accept` only honors it for root, so it
//     reconciles a wave's tasks left owned by an agent that already finished
//     (and will never sync to apply its own proposal) instead of stalling on
//     the orphan. --defer-landing skips accept's own "did the branch reach
//     trunk?" check: accept necessarily runs BEFORE integrate here (integrate
//     refuses a non-done task), so checking now would always see "not yet"
//     and durably record that on every task this run is about to land —
//     recordWaveLanding (below, step 2b) records the real verdict instead,
//     once integrate has had its chance (dacli 329).
//  2. integrate— shell `dacli integrate --tasks <done seqs> --into <branch>`:
//     merge each done task's branch. A conflict blocks that task; ship
//     detects the block and stops before committing or pushing.
//     2b. landing — recordWaveLanding re-checks and stamps the true landing
//     verdict for every task accept closed this run, now that integrate has
//     run (or been skipped). Runs even when integrate stops on a conflict or
//     a hard error, so a genuinely unlanded close still reads as unlanded.
//  3. record   — stage ONLY .dacli (NEVER `git add -A`, the footgun that once
//     tracked a worktree gitlink) and commit the workspace state.
//  4. push     — with --push, push the integration branch; without it, print the
//     push command so the operator stays in control.
//
// `--dry-run` prints each step it would run and executes nothing.
