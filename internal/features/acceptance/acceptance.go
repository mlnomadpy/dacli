// Package acceptance is the supervisor-native close: `dacli accept` verifies an
// agent's completion and closes the task in one owner-set-policy step, replacing
// the per-spawn manual `task check --all` + `task done` ritual.
//
// It is a feature slice (ARCHITECTURE § 2b) and imports NO other slice — the
// close is expressed purely over store primitives (CheckAllAcceptance, SaveTask,
// MoveTask) and the event log, so the arch_test's isolation rule holds.
//
// Two paths, chosen by grant exactly as `task done` does:
//
//   - The OWNER (rw) runs `dacli accept <ref> [--verify "cmd"]`: an optional
//     verification command gates the close (a non-zero exit REFUSES the accept,
//     exit 1 — never close a task whose checks fail), then every acceptance box
//     is checked and the task moves to done. `--all` accepts, in one pass, every
//     task an agent has proposed for acceptance.
//   - A read-only AGENT runs the same command and, unable to rewrite the task,
//     records a box-check PROPOSAL as an event. The owner's accept applies it —
//     the child proposes, the owner decides.
