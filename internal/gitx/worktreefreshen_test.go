// A worktree created for a NEW branch is cut from HEAD and starts current. One
// created for an EXISTING branch is checked out at whatever commit that branch
// was left at, and nothing advanced it.
//
// That is invisible for a one-shot task, and compounding for a recurring one.
// The standing continuous-improvement anchor keeps its branch across every
// cycle, so an auditor was handed a tree arbitrarily far behind trunk and asked
// to find bugs in code where the fixes had not been applied — reported at 34
// commits behind, re-reporting seven already-closed defects (issue #441). Those
// phantom findings then spawn fixer agents that rebuild work that exists.
